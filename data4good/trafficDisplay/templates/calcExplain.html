    <h2>Our Metrics</h2>
    <p>
        Our three main metrics are <b>Likelihood of Crash</b>, <b>Crash Severity</b>, and <b>Overall Risk Factor</b>. The 
        <b>Overall Risk Factor</b> is a combination of the first two. These metrics integrate various data sources to create a holistic 
        view of crash probabilities based on the user's <b>location, weather conditions, date, and time</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We selected these metrics because they provide essential information to assess potential risks to a driver and their vehicle.
    </p>

    <h2>Likelihood of Crash</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>Likelihood of Crash</b> metric uses constituency data (linked in the footer) to provide location-based crash statistics.
        This data represents the number of crashes occurring within a constituency, normalized against a national average. By comparing
        this information, we determine whether a driver in a specific area is at <b>higher or lower risk</b> of a collision compared 
        to the national average in England.
    </p>

    <h2>Crash Severity</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>Crash Severity</b> metric estimates the severity of an accident, assuming a crash occurs. This calculation uses data from 
        two sources (linked in the footer) to determine the probability of different crash outcomes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Slight:</b> No hospital treatment required</li>
        <li><b>Serious:</b> Hospital treatment required</li>
        <li><b>Fatal:</b> Death or permanent injury</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Like the <b>Likelihood of Crash</b>, this metric considers <b>location, weather, date, and time</b>, and the results are normalized 
        against a national average.
    </p>

    <h2>Overall Risk Factor</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>Overall Risk Factor</b> is a score out of 100 that combines both <b>Likelihood of Crash</b> and <b>Crash Severity</b> to 
        provide a comprehensive risk assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
        A score of <b>50 represents the average risk level</b>â€”values above or below this indicate <b>higher or lower risk</b> relative to 
        national trends.
    </p>
